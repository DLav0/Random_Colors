I created this using bootstrap, Primarily to style the button.  It does what I want.  I'm wondering if there is a more
efficient way to mark up the spans for each letter, or to create all the query Selectors.  Maybe using class?  

Not really as exciting as I thought it would be.  Colors are kind of pastel looking.  I wonder if I could redefine the random colors function to 
make them more intense.  Could add another button to access these more intense colors.
